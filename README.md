## üöÄ Quick Start

Load the dataset into your Python environment using pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Inspect data
print(df.info())
print(df.head())
üìä Example Visualization
Let‚Äôs plot a Sales Distribution by Region using Python and Seaborn:

python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('Superstore.csv')

# Set the visual style
sns.set(style="whitegrid")

# Create a boxplot of Sales by Region
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.boxplot(data=df, x='Region', y='Sales', palette='Set2')
plt.title('Sales Distribution by Region', fontsize=16)
plt.xlabel('Region')
plt.ylabel('Sales')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
